      Hello! My name is Gladys and I am a 5th year Computer Science Student at Illinois Institute of Technology.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>A couple things about me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This is my final semester at Illinois Tech. I will be graduating with both my bachelor's and master's in Computer Science</li>
      <li>I am the president of the Association for Computing Machinery-Women on Campus. Join the ACMW mailing list <a href="https://forms.gle/cNHywCUGBfjtWbEq6">here</a>.</li>
      <li>I own two dogs and a cat. 
        <ul>
          <li>My cat is about 10 years old and quite an affectionate old grump.</li>
          <li>My first dog is 5 years old now, we got her just as I was entering uni. She's a Maltese Poodle mix and very affectionate.</li>
          <li>My second dog is only 4 months old. We got her this past summer and she's quite big and we suspect she's not done growing. She is a Husky German Shepard Mix and very playful.</li>
